# AMCAT Engineering Employment Analytics: Unraveling Career Patterns

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the AMCAT Engineering Employment dataset to uncover career patterns and insights among engineering graduates. The dataset provides information on demographic features, educational background, standardized skill scores, and employment-related variables such as salary, job titles, and job locations.

## Dataset Description

The AMCAT Engineering Employment dataset comprises around 40 independent variables and 4000 data points. It includes features such as:

- Demographic information (gender, date of birth)
- Educational background (10th and 12th percentage, college GPA)
- Standardized skill scores (AMCAT scores in English, Logical, Quantitative sections)
- Employment outcomes (salary, job titles, job locations)

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the employment outcomes of engineering graduates. Key goals include:

1. Identifying factors influencing employment outcomes (salary, job titles, locations).
2. Analyzing skill assessments and their impact on employment prospects.
3. Investigating gender-specific career patterns and potential disparities in salary and designation.
4. Providing actionable insights for stakeholders to improve career counseling, recruitment strategies, and overall employability of engineering graduates.
